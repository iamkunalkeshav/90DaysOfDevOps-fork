# 90-Day DevOps Learning Plan

## Current Level
I am a working IT professional. I have worked around Azure-based environments and understand how cloud setups are used in real projects.  
I’m comfortable with the basics, but I haven’t yet worked deeply on end-to-end DevOps pipelines or Kubernetes on my own.  
This plan is about closing that gap with consistent hands-on practice.

## My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud
For me, DevOps is about making sure applications run smoothly from development to production.  
It’s not just tools, but understanding systems, automating repetitive work, and being responsible when things break.  
Cloud platforms like AWS/Azure/GCP make this possible by providing scalable and reliable infrastructure.

## Why I’m Learning DevOps Now
While working in cloud-supported projects, I realized I don’t want to stay limited to surface-level involvement.  
I want to clearly understand what’s happening behind deployments, infrastructure, and production issues, and be able to handle them myself.  
That’s why I’m focusing seriously on DevOps and cloud skills now.

## Where I Want to Be in 90 Days
Over the next 90 days, I want to move from partial cloud exposure to confident, hands-on execution.  
By the end of this period, I aim to:
1. Design and deploy a containerized application with proper configuration, logging, and basic monitoring.
2. Build and maintain a CI/CD pipeline that handles build, test, and deployment with minimal manual intervention.
3. Understand how production environments are structured and be able to troubleshoot common deployment and infrastructure issues independently.

## Core Skills I’m Focusing On
1. Linux-based system operations, logs, and production-level troubleshooting  
2. CI/CD automation to reduce manual deployment effort and errors  
3. Container orchestration using Kubernetes for scalable and repeatable deployments

## Time Commitment
- Weekdays: around 3-4 hours per day  
- Weekends: 7-8 hours  
- Rule: no zero days, even if it’s just revision

---

## How I’ll Stay Consistent
- Fixed daily study time
- More practice, less theory
- Weekly self-check on what I actually learned
- Keep moving forward, even on slow days

---

## Commitment
I’m committing the next 90 days to learning DevOps properly and building the skills needed to work confidently in real environments.
